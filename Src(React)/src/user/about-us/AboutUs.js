                Since day one we have strived to be the Earth’s most customer-centric company. We’re honored to be recognized for the work we do on behalf of our customers, employees, and communities around the world. Here are some recent awards we’ve received.
                The customer is at the heart of everything we do. KYN Online Stores is a place where smart, passionate people obsess over customers and innovate on their behalf. KYN Online Stores has created more U.S. jobs in the last decade than any other company. These are jobs that pay an average of $18 per hour, more than double the federal minimum wage. We also invest in employees’ success. KYN Online Stores will spend over $1.2 billion to provide free skills training to employees—helping them further their careers in tech and in-demand roles such as cloud computing.
                Along with an average starting pay of $18 per hour—more than double the federal minimum wage—Store offers a range of great benefits that support employees and eligible family members, including domestic partners and their children. These comprehensive benefits begin on day one and include health care coverage, paid parental leave, ways to save for the future, paid college tuition, and other resources to improve health and well-being.
                We want to make it easy for people to have access to the skills they need to grow their careers. And we’re making two big investments to help make that happen by 2025. First, we’re committing more than $1.2 billion to provide free education and skills training opportunities to more than 300,000 of our own employees in the U.S. to help them secure new, high-growth jobs. We are also investing hundreds of millions of dollars to provide free cloud computing skills training to 29 million people around the world with programs for the public.
                Upskilling programs helps employees gain in-demand skill sets and propel them into new careers. The company-funded training programs offered through Upskilling 2025 support KYN Online Stores's employees as they learn critical skills to move into in-demand, higher-paying technical or non-technical roles within Store and beyond.
 
 Looking at job growth over the next decade, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics anticipates that some of the fastest growing job areas are increasingly in more skilled areas, including medical assistants, statisticians, software developers, nurse practitioners, and wind turbine service technicians. Through Upskilling 2025, Online Store is focused on creating pathways to careers in areas that will continue growing in years to come.
