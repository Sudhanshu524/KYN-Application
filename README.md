The Scope of the Project is to enhance already developed Know-Your-Neighborhood Application with different login functionalities i.e. Google Login, Facebook Login and Normal Login and to do research of different existing APIs and compare for each of your examples and evaluate their suitability while also identifying any potential security issues and build a login with selected API in existing website.


A Spring MVC provides an elegant solution to use MVC in spring framework by the help of DispatcherServlet. Here, DispatcherServlet is a class that receives the incoming request and maps it to the right resource such as controllers, models, and views.
For Front-End I've used React Js because it is Faster and a lightweight language.
As per the scenario REST APIs is used in our project to provide API development environments because one of the key benefits of REST APIs is their high level of flexibility. 

User can select a suitable login API among 3 different login APIs in research in the project scenario.

1. Google Login API
2. Facebook Login
3. Normal Login through Registration
